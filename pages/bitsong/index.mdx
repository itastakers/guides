## What is BitSong?

BitSong is a distributed (open source) blockchain music ecosystem born in December 2017 to create a decentralized and trustless hub that interconnects the music industry’s market players.

Our mission is to decentralize the music sector by simplifying the bureaucracy to offer artists a meritocratic, transparent, fast and intermediary-free earnings model while users gain a new way to listen to music and earn money.

BitSong is not just a streaming platform. It’s a decentralized ecosystem of services providing the global community of artists, fans and music providers with a trustless music marketplace that becomes the industry’s point of reference.

    <h2>Governance</h2>
    <p>Validators and delegators can vote on proposals that are then able to change the parameters of the system, coordinate upgrades, and vote on governance policies</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Staking</h2>
    <p>Process of actively participating in transaction validation, similar to mining but on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Anyone with any BTSG tokens can validate transactions and earn staking rewards  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Community Pool</h2>
    <p>A percentage of all staking rewards generated (via block rewards and transactions fees) are continually transferred to and accrue within the Community Pool. The governance can open proposals on how to spend BTSG funds</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h2>NFT</h2>
    <p>NFTs are non-fungible tokens. They act as a non-duplicable digital certificate of ownership for any assigned digital asset. Once the NFT is purchased, the owner has the digital rights to resell, distribute or license the digital asset as they please</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Fan Token</h2>
    <p>Digital assets represent your ownership of a voting right and give you access to earn unique club-specific rewards and experiences. Fan Tokens are fungible (unlike NFTs), meaning that like other cryptocurrencies, they can be exchanged for other ‘goods’, such as VIP experiences, exclusive merchandise and tickets</p>
